# 🚀 StratOS: The Living Strategic Twin

**“CEOs make billion-dollar bets based on gut feeling.  
But what if you could simulate the consequences first?”**

🥁 *Drums Rolling…*

## 🧠 What Is StratOS?

**StratOS** is the world’s first **Living Strategic Twin**, powered by **Gemini**.

While traditional BI tools analyze **what already happened**, StratOS simulates **what *will* happen** using **Generative Game Theory**.

It enables leaders to:
- Simulate high-stakes strategic decisions
- Predict **specific competitor counter-moves**
- Generate execution-ready implementation blueprints  
- **War-game the future before spending a single dollar**

---

## 💡 The Problem

### Strategic Decision-Making Is Broken

Executives today rely on:
- Gut instinct
- Static spreadsheets
- Backward-looking dashboards

### The Cost
- **67% of strategic plans fail** due to unforeseen second-order effects

### The Gap
- No tool simulates **competitor retaliation**
- Traditional AI gives **generic advice**
- There is no “chess engine” for strategy that plays out moves and counter-moves

---

## 🛠️ The Solution: StratOS

StratOS upgrades the idea of a **chatbot** into a **full-scale simulation engine**.

### 🔁 How It Works

#### 1. Twin Synchronization
- Ingests company profile, market conditions, and strategic objectives
- Creates a live digital twin of the organization and its environment

#### 2. Generative Game Theory Engine
- Uses **Nash Equilibrium reasoning**
- Assigns AI agents with personas such as:
  - *Ruthless Competitor*
  - *Regulatory Adversary*
  - *Market Disruptor*
- Stress-tests every strategic move

#### 3. Competitor Retaliation Simulation
- Predicts likely counter-strategies
- Models second- and third-order effects
- Identifies hidden risks before execution

#### 4. Visual Logic & Execution
- Converts unstructured strategic reasoning into:
  - **React Flow Data Flow Diagrams**
  - Clear execution blueprints
- Makes strategy actionable, not abstract

## ⚙️ Technical Implementation

### 🖥️ Frontend
- **Next.js 16 (App Router)**
- **Framer Motion**
  - Visualizes “Reasoning Traces”
  - Animates decision paths and outcomes

### 🤖 AI Engine
- **Google Gemini Pro / Gemini Flash**
- Integrated via **Vercel AI SDK**
- Enforced **JSON schema outputs** for:
  - `competitor_profile`
  - `risk_heatmap`

### 📊 Visualization
- **react-flow**
- **dagre**
  - Automated layout for execution graphs
- Dynamic **risk heatmaps**
  - Computed using semantic analysis of the scenario

## 🌍 Real-World Viability

StratOS transforms **strategy from an art into a science**.

### Who It’s For
- Startup founders deciding on pivots
- Scaleups planning market expansion
- Fortune 500 CEOs evaluating acquisitions or pricing wars

### What It Delivers
- Clear foresight into competitive dynamics
- Reduced uncertainty in high-impact decisions
- A repeatable, defensible strategic process

## 🔮 Stop Guessing. Start Simulating.

**This is StratOS.**


This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

Experience the power of AI-driven strategic decision-making with our deployed web app!

👉 **Live Demo:** [https://ceo-in-a-box.vercel.app/](https://ceo-in-a-box.vercel.app/)

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

The user must install bun.

```bash
bun i
bun run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
